Difficulties with Redux:
    - immutability: careful with how we are updating state, can cause side effects
        - do not mutate state
        - redux-immutable-state-invariant
    - naming actions:
    - patterns for async vs sync actions
        - react optimistic updpates
    - if we have alot of back and forth with server
        - its hard to update nested objects immutably
        - could use immutable.js
        - could use normalizer.js to flatten the state
        - we could also just flatten our state.
    - separate ui state from data state.

Nature based file structure - has issues, makes modularization difficult
- look at dashboard file structure - makes sense to me.
