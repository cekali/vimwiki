= Lerna cleanup items: =
* [X] Add back remaining scripts to package.json
* [ ] cleanup dev dependencies in meridian package
* [ ] Bring dependencies in line between modules
* [ ] Identify changes made to charting/dashboard
* [X] Why is DashFrame.spec.js commented out?
* [X] git ignore dist?
* [X] is eslint.rc in the wrong spot?
    - should be one in /app and /test
* [X] babel-polyfill is commented out in meridian.js
* [X] dashboard_graph_card.jsx (which branch did this come from)
    - This came from vis, don't need in master
* [X] view_dashboard_layout.js (make sure content is correct)
* [X] revert youtube_filters_view.jsx
* [X] make sure *.configs are in the right place
* [X] make sure all references to ./node_modules are updpated to ../../node_modules
    - I don't think all references need to be updated.
    - We will have to inform users that this is something to pay attention to.
* [X] make sure webpack configs are in the correct places
* [X] why is clean-webpack-plugin removed from webpack.test-config.js
    - I originally removed it because it was failing, but it seems to work fine atm.
* [X] what is up with this file: /test/intern/support/config/dev-local.js
