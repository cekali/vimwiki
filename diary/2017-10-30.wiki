= Typescript =
== pro ==
- if it compiles, it will run
- More "modern" feel -- More java server side functionality
- Easier to ramp up than we thought
- Tooling is really good
- A little better at self documenting
- Works well for Library style code

== con ==
- adds overhead, small changes have cascading work
- no runtime protection
    - problem is exacerbated by not being fully typescript
- not worth converting everything
- only having some as typescript creates a barrier to entry
    - Learning curve
    - This project is in typescript, and no one wants to touch it
    - Setup is required
- Transition was more involved than anticipated

== questions ==
- Is there any reason an individual can't use it?

= Random questions =
- Who uses category?
