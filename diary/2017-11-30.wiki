Yesterday:
    - Pushed a fix for the scp azkaban job
    - Talked with Josh about the most recent training failure
        - He had a few suggestions of things to try
Today
    - I want to experiment with Josh's suggestions. In order to do so, I need to finish standing
      up my local environment.
    - I'm also going to turn on continuous training and monitor it throughout the day
