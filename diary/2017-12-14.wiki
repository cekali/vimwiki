= my random questions =
- what is the distinction between dc/os and mesosphere?
- where does marathon fit in?
- F5? to load balance across datacenters?
- ntp must be running. What is ntp?

= intro =
- microservices
- 12Factor
- containers
- "Digital Transformation requires data-intensive applications operating at scale"
- modern enterprise stack requires
    - Cload native tech; Distributed computing expertise; DevOps process and culture;
- customer impact
    - Accelerate time to market; ensure resilience and automation; save money in datacenter or cloud
- Hyperscale operations
    - mesosphere dcos allows us to abstract away from the individual machines
    - Everything runs on same shared cluster. Allows higher level of utilization
- Smack stack: 
  
= Kick Start =
- Recommends the use of Advanced Install
    - most people automate the advanced install
    - Should do it by hand at least once
- installs made with cli or gui can never be upgraded, would require a full reinstall
- Could provider templates
    - Not only creates the dcos cluster, sets up the underlying cloud infrastructure. then executes 
      the cli/gui install process
- bootstrap node coordiates startup
- master nodes, more than one on any cluster you care about, come in odd numbers
    - the brain of the cluster
- Agent nodes run the workloads
- install steps are taken on the bootstrap node,
    - spin up webserver on bootstrap
    - distribute info to all other nodes
    - There will be files on the bootstrap that will be needed to upgrade
    - however, the bootstrap does not need to remain running
- Two types of agens
    - public and private
    - public agents are connected to internal and external networks
    - private agents are only connected to internal networks
= Master nodes =
- reccomend 3 masters for dev, and 5 masters for prod
- Cannot horizontally scale master nodes
- masters love ssds
- ntp must be running, ntp must be in sync
