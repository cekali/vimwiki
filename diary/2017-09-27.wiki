== Holdovers ==
- [X] Get Lerna to deploy
    1. I had removed .npmrc from that branch, so it was looking at wrong registry
    2. sass is looking in root node_modules rather than package node_modules
        - Not sure why the tests build correctly though?
    3. No template for dependency: TemplateArgumentDependency
        - Internet suggested it is caused by having multiple webpack installations.  
        - I removed dev dependencies from packages/meridian to resolve
        - I bet the unit tests will fail now though...
        - Added back the dependencies, removed wepack only
        - Worked locally, but failed when I tried on the server.
        - Changed setting of build step to clean resources
    4. Currently gets a cors exception, not sure if this is my fault or not.
        - It was not. Nectar was down. Re-deployed master to feature-1 and it works!
- [X] Write up pictures from yesterday
- [X] Figure out privleges for Jira
    - I def. do not have them. Talking to diego about adding privleges
    - Diego gave me ability to add status.
