I was going to comment in the PR, but it’s so cluttered, and I want to leave space for conversation, so I’m going to post a list here. There are basically 3 categories of comments: 1. Must be changed before being merged. 2. Should be changed, if not immediately, a tech debt ticket should be created. 3. This is mostly opinion, and should be an opportunity for discussion/learning. Shortening those descriptions, we have Required, Optional, Opinion.

Required:
    Push state down into ToggleButton, probably remove Wrapper
    GlobalStyles -> either reduce to only the set of things we want to use, or put the styles in the relevant components
    Follow through on @nbever's last comment regarding StatisticToggleButton
Optional: 
    Change the mode prop in favor of multiple props
    Change styles in ToggleButton to use aphrodite
Opinion:
    Everything not covered above.
